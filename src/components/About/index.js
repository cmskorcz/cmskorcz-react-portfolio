      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Chase Skorczewski, and I am a Michigan State University Coding Bootcamp student. I have a passion for helping others, which lead me to becoming a paramedic. My goal is to use my knowledge of the medical field to eventually develop systems to better streamline patient care.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests in the coding field include: Front-End, Back-End, Data Analysis, and Internet of Things. After finishing my bootcamp in web development, my next pursuit will be to learn Python.
